# flatpress
Unofficial FlatPress version to be run in PHP 7.2<br>
<br>
Official FlatPress site: http://flatpress.org/<br>
Official FlatPress GitHub project: https://github.com/evacchi/flatpress

## What is that?
The development of FlatPress was discontinued by its author [Edoardo Vacchi](https://github.com/evacchi/). A big salute to your years of effort on this really great flatfile blogging system, Sir!<br>
The last FlatPress version 1.0.3 works nicely in PHP 5, but fails in PHP 7. The goal of this fork is to keep it running in current PHP versions. It starts with version 1.0.3.php7.

## What can you expect?
We'll try to keep FlatPress and its plugins in its feature set of version 1.0.3 usable with current PHP versions. Even if incidentally some bugs may be fixed, this fork is not supposed to build new features and functions into FlatPress.
